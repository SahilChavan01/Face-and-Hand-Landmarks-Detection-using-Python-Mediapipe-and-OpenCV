# Face-and-Hand-Landmarks-Detection-using-Python-Mediapipe-and-OpenCV
Using the MediaPipe Python library and its Holistic model, we can detect face and hand landmarks. This allows us to identify all relevant points on the face and hands. We will also explore how to access these landmarks for applications such as sign language interpretation and drowsiness detection in computer vision.
